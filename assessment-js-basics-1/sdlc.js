// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements 
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const Analysisofrequirements = "This is the second step, in which you figure out what is wrong with the code and what actions are needed to fix or create."

const design = "This is the third step, in which you put your planning and analysis into action. To make things run smoothly and become more and more effecient and clean."

const TestingandIntergration = "This is the fourth step, in which you check to see if your program is running and looking clean, Developers use this step to see if they put in anythign wrong or forgot something."

const Implementation = "This is the fifth step, after the work checks out and it is ready to be put back out, you pubslish it and make sure it runs smoothly with all the other code going on."

const Maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, after your code is running smoothly again, you must still keep up with it. I won't stay perfect forever!"
